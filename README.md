## Idea
Development on an App by implementing an API, with additional design features

## Steps:
1. Set-up team, the repository and discuss basic ideas
==> this was easy
2. Find a project which is not boring, rewarding but still gives up options to design within two days
==> this was most difficult and time consuming (24 hours). We tried three projects before we found something appropriate for the level of our knowledge. We looked at a 'time tracking api' and  a 'two-way authorisation API'. These did not work because we could not 'post' data instead of 'get'. In the end we decided for a URL-shortener api
3. Implement the index.js and checking if it worked
==> managable ==> fast forward
4. Collecting ideas about specific design possibilities
- colors
- possibilities in general
- emojies?
- text
==> design makes the app valueable and differentiate between several offers. We experienced different kind of options in coloring text. Even dynamic text was possible but not an option for us as we felt that the result should be easily visible to be copied.
5. We decided for an addition npm-module 'chalk'. This gave us the posibility to change text colors, backgroundcolors and even linear gradients. Additional design were possible by adding further npm modules, but we restrictive.
6. Text. We wanted toadd at least some text-elements providing some interaction. Input was not possible on an terminal. But some general text elements seemed important to us.
7. An additional graphic element was implemented. The duck is a little nice feature.
8. Further structure was suggested by a surrounding frame to give a better project-structure. 
9 Final changes in design questions and work on documentation and presentation of the project.
10. Satisfied members of the team.

## Experience on working together
After getting to the point of a clear task we felt much better in our situation. Nevertheless the exercise showed that the experience is interesting. We were not able to make a structured working plan because of the missing expereience and missing understanding what is expected and waht is might be possible.
The team developed a team feeling after we solved major problems and since we focussed on the project itselve after decisions were made. In the end the team members worked on individual aspects of the project and we had no critical issues on working together.
